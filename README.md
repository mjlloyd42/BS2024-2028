# ECE-1000 FALL 2024 FINAL PROJECT: ROBOTIC ARM
This GitHub contains all relevant files used during the development of our Robotic Arm project for ECE 1000.
## Project Summary
  For this project, we created a robotic arm that moves along the x and y axis with claw capabilities. The materials used were a Raspberry Pi Pico W mounted on a pico-breadboard, 3 micro-servomotors, and an analog 2-axis joystick. Thonny IDE was used to write to the Raspberry Pi for programming. All three motors can be moved simultaneously with the use of a single joystick based on the x- and y-coordinates of the joystick, and whether the button was pressed or not. 

## Project Capabilities 
  * A single joystick is used to move and control three micro-servomotors simultaneously.
  * The joystick can be used to initiate a 'claw' effect on the third micro-servomotor.
