# ECE-1000 FALL 2024 FINAL PROJECT: ROBOTIC ARM
This GitHub repository contains all relevant files used during the development of our Robotic Arm project for ECE 1000.
## Project Summary
  For this project, we created a robotic arm that moves along the x- and y-axis with potential claw capabilities. The materials used were a Raspberry Pi Pico W mounted on a pico-breadboard, 3 micro-servomotors, and an analog 2-axis joystick. Thonny IDE was used to write to the Raspberry Pi for programming. All three motors can be moved simultaneously with the use of a single joystick based on the x- and y-coordinates of the joystick, and whether the button was pressed or not. Due to print delays, we did not have the opportunity to assemble our 3D-printed arm with all the parts. Otherwise, the servomotors and joystick are functional and work as intended for use with a 3D-printed arm. 

## Project Capabilities 
  * A single joystick is used to move and control three micro-servomotors simultaneously.
  * The joystick can be used to initiate a 'claw' effect on the third micro-servomotor.
  * With a 3D-printed arm, the program and servomotors can be used to pick up items with a claw smoothly without needing to toggle between motors.
