# ECE-1000 FALL 2024 FINAL PROJECT: ROBOTIC ARM
This GitHub contains all relevant files used during the development of our Robotic Arm project for ECE 1000.
## Project Summary
  For our final project we created a robotic arm to simply move from left and right and pick up objects. The project involved the use of a Raspberry Pi Pico, a Wii nunchuck, servo motors and some wiring. Three motors were used but one motor is controlled by the joystick at a time. You could switch to each motor by pressing a button.

## Project Capabilities 
  Motors can be controlled using a joystick
  Taking control of different motors
